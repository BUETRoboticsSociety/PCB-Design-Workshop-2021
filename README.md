# PCB-Design-Workshop-2021
PCB design workshop organized by BUET Robotics Society, in collaboration with Engineer's Hub BD on 25 March, 2021.

## Getting Started

- Download the Proteus 8.6 design suite setup file from <a href="https://www.freesoftwarefiles.com/education/proteus-professional-8-6-free-download/">this link</a>.
- You can follow <a href="https://youtu.be/R6R6jASjdbw">this video</a> for installation.
- Starter files have been provided prior to the workshop that will be used during the workshop for designing a PCB, the participants are encouraged to try and simulate the circuit to see if everything is working. PCB design based on this circuit will be discussed during the workshop session.
- <a href="https://github.com/BUETRoboticsSociety/PCB-Design-Workshop-2021/blob/main/Online%20Session/Circuit%20Test.pdsprj">Starter file 1</a> - a basic clock counter circuit based on 555 timer IC and alphanumeric display output. Running the simulation shows the display counting up from 0 to 9.
- <a href="https://github.com/BUETRoboticsSociety/PCB-Design-Workshop-2021/blob/main/Online%20Session/Circuit%20PCB.pdsprj">Starter file 2</a> - demo PCB design based on starter file 1.
- <a href="https://github.com/BUETRoboticsSociety/PCB-Design-Workshop-2021/tree/main/Online%20Session/Datasheets">Directory</a> containing the datasheets of components used in starter file 1.
